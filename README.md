# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting credit card fraud. The project uses a dataset of credit card transactions to build and evaluate models that can identify fraudulent transactions. It demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various classification algorithms.

## Instructions to setup and run project
- To install required dependencies: ```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn```
- To run the fraud detection script, use: ```python credit_card_fraud_detection.py```
- The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance. You will see metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as a confusion matrix.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is creditcard.csv, which contains anonymized credit card transactions. Each row represents a transaction with various features, and the Class column indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
